Project #1: Number Conversion Service Project #URL: Number Conversion Service API #Documentation:https://www.dataaccess.com/webservicesserver/NumberConversion.wso?op=NumberToWords

Project Description This project involves testing the SOAP API for number to words conversion. The API converts numerical input into its English word equivalent. The testing focuses on validating the functionality of the API endpoint and handling various input scenarios.

Test Cases A set of Postman test cases have been created to cover different scenarios for the number to words conversion API. These include positive and negative test cases to ensure robustness and accuracy in conversion results.
